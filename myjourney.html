                <h2>Skills Development</h2>
                <p>I am actively working on developing a range of essential skills to build a strong foundation in AI and Cyber Security. These skills include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Introduction to Programming:</strong> I am learning the basics of Python and Java, focusing on syntax, control structures, and functions. Through hands-on exercises, I have been able to write simple programs that perform various tasks, such as data manipulation and interactive input/output.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding AI Concepts:</strong> Delving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, I am gaining insights into how AI functions, from machine learning algorithms to neural networks. I am particularly intrigued by AI's applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and automation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Cyber Security Awareness:</strong> Cyber security is essential in today’s digital age. I am learning about different types of cyber threats, encryption techniques, and security protocols that help in protecting systems from unauthorized access. Topics such as firewalls, malware, and ethical hacking have been introduced to me.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Programming challenges have become a key part of my routine to enhance my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. These challenges involve writing efficient algorithms, debugging code, and optimizing performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> I am familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub, which are essential for managing code versions and collaborating on projects. I’ve learned to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members through branching and pull requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has allowed me to start building simple websites. I am also exploring how front-end and back-end development integrates to create dynamic web applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> In addition to coding, I have started learning about fundamental data structures (arrays, lists, stacks) and algorithms that help in efficiently organizing and processing data.</li>
                </ul>
