                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Theeraphat Poungngoen, and I am currently pursuing my studies at CSTU. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the limitless possibilities that technology offers, especially in the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber Security. These fields not only represent the future but also play a critical role in shaping how we interact with the digital world.</p>
                <p>My journey into AI started with a curiosity about how machines can mimic human intelligence. This curiosity has since evolved into a deep passion for understanding and developing AI systems that can solve complex problems, enhance decision-making, and drive innovation across various industries. Whether it's through machine learning, natural language processing, or robotics, I'm constantly seeking to explore new frontiers in AI.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, my interest in Cyber Security stems from a desire to protect and secure the digital world we increasingly rely on. In an age where data breaches and cyber threats are becoming more common, I believe that securing information and systems is more important than ever. I am committed to learning about the latest security protocols, ethical hacking, and defensive strategies to safeguard sensitive data and infrastructure.</p>
                <p>At CSTU, I have the opportunity to dive deep into these subjects, collaborate with like-minded peers, and work on projects that challenge and expand my understanding. My goal is to build a career where I can merge my interests in AI and Cyber Security, contributing to innovations that are not only intelligent but also secure.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion and exploring opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact in the tech world.</p>
